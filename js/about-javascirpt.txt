Assalamu alaikum.

Today I have completed JavaScript BootCamp Batch-8. Actually frankly speaking, I was interested to learn JavaScript from any platform which will teach me mastering JavaScript. After that i come to  know about this JavaScript Ninja form YouTube and then i admited.

When i admited this platform i haven't thougth i will be able to learn so many things from this platform. I learned from this course. How to think to solve a particular problem. How can i make a project form my own knowledge. How can i make step to complete a project. How to organize code, Object oriented programming, API with JSON and so many things.

I seem to this is active platform in Bangladesh who are teaching JavaScript without any cheating. When i face any problem to do our daily task i just knock skype group or any modarator they tried there best to help me. 

I will highly recommend to all who are interested to learing JavaScript. They should join this course once in a life  becuase they want to learn javaScript and this platform  will help they to improve  there programming logic,clean coding,problem solving skill and so many things.
